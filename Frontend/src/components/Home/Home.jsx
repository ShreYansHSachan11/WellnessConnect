        The 3rd Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 3) aims to ensure healthy
        lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. It addresses key
        health priorities such as reducing maternal and child mortality,
        combating communicable and non-communicable diseases, and improving
        mental health. Achieving this goal requires strengthening healthcare
        systems, increasing access to essential medicines and vaccines, and
        addressing health determinants like clean water and sanitation. Efforts
        to meet SDG 3 are vital for sustainable development, as good health is
        foundational to the economic, social, and environmental well-being of
        societies.
